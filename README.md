## Crime Incident Prediction System
The integration of machine learning into a crime prediction system aims to analyze historical data, anticipate potential crime occurrences, and improve decision-making for safety management. This project streamlines crime risk assessment and enables proactive preventive actions by forecasting crime likelihood across different locations.
 
## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
CrimePredict ML is an educational and analytical platform developed to predict crime likelihood using advanced machine learning techniques. Traditional crime monitoring relies on manual analysis of past incidents and human observation, which can be time-consuming and error-prone.

This project addresses such gaps by offering a user-friendly interface where users can analyze historical crime datasets, train ML models, explore patterns, and predict risk levels based on selected parameters such as location, time of day, and day of the week.

The system visualizes patterns, generates probability-based predictions, and enables students and researchers to learn and experiment with real-world crime prediction workflows.
